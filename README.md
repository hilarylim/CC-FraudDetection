# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Mini Project #3 

The codes done by Jeya and myself over the span of 2 weeks. 
\
**Objective #1:** to determine which model can help to detect fraud with higher accuracy 
\
**Objective #2:** how much it costs the company if it is false positive or false negative

## Codes and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.8 \
**Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, imblearn, xgboost, catboost, lightgbm, keras, tensorflow \
**Dataset:** provided by the school (Institute of Data)

## Data Overview 
Dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. There are a total of 31 variables including time, amount and class (fraudulent transaction or non-fraudulent).

## Model Building
With the assumption that: 
* 1 fraudulent transaction costs = EUR 162 (including an average of EUR 33k p.a. of a Fraud Analyst salary; & 
* 1 incorrect labelled transaction costs = EUR 40 

Below is a summary of the models of the Precision, Recall, F1 scores and the costs it the company has to bear if the company implements the respective approach(es).

## Takeaways 
From our findings, it shows that: 
* higher score  â‰   lesser costs 
* retrieve relevant data to minimise time spent in detecting fraudulent transactions real-time 
* keeping updated with technology advancements (in terms of devices used, firewalls, to individual's knowledge)
